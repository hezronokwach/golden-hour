Building ElderLink in 4 hours is an excellent move. You are shifting from a "Productivity" context to a "Care" context using the same emotional detection logic.

🔄 The Workflow: From Voice to Care
The workflow follows a Passive Observation → Active Intervention cycle.

Continuous Listening: The AI (Hume EVI) stays active. The elderly user talks naturally about their day.

Emotional Analysis: The program extracts scores for Loneliness, Confusion, and Distress.

Threshold Trigger: * If Loneliness stays high (>0.7) for several minutes, the AI triggers a "Companion Event."

If Confusion spikes suddenly, the AI triggers a "Safety Event."

UI/API Reaction: The UI shifts from a simple clock/date view to a Support View (photos or alerts).

🎭 Two Demonstration Scenarios
To win over judges, you must show the program handling two distinct "Human Problems."

Scenario 1: The "Sundowning" or Confusion Loop
The Problem: The senior repeats the same question or sounds lost.

The Demo: * User: "Where is my daughter? I haven't seen her... wait, what time is it? I think I'm supposed to be somewhere." (Sounding shaky/confused).

AI Logic: Hume detects high Confusion and Anxiety.

Action: The AI speaks in a very calm, slow tone: "It's 2:00 PM, Mary. Your daughter Sarah is coming by at 5:00. Why don't we look at some photos of your grandkids while we wait?"

UI Change: The screen automatically slides in a Digital Photo Album of family members with names labeled in large text.

Scenario 2: The "Silent Loneliness" Check-in
The Problem: The user hasn't spoken much, and their voice sounds flat/depressed.

The Demo:

User: "I'm just... I'm just sitting here. It's so quiet today." (Low energy, high sadness).

AI Logic: Hume detects Loneliness and Sorrow.

Action: The AI recognizes the emotional low and triggers a "Social Bridge." It says, "I hear you, Mary. It is a bit quiet. I’ve sent a quick note to your son to let him know you’re up for a chat. In the meantime, would you like to hear that Frank Sinatra song you love?"

UI Change: A "Music Player" widget appears and starts playing a specific song.
